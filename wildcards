Wildcards are a great tool for working with text data.

ques---> product lookup table with alphanumerical SKUs (i.e. small_shirt-123), and wanted to see how many times each SKU appeared in a sales table.

Easy… COUNTIF( sales_range, sku ), right?

The problem was that the SKUs in the sales table were concatenated with other text strings (i.e. 210819&small_shirt-123.large_shirt-456&store-y), so he wasn’t getting any matches.

Here’s where the wildcards come in 😉

Wildcards are special characters used for “fuzzy” text matching.

👉 The asterisk (*) represents zero or more characters
👉 The question mark (?) represents a single character

For example: “*en*” will return “enrique”, “bend”, and “cement”, but “?en?” will only return “bend”.

Therefore, wrapping a text string in asterisks (*) asks if that text string is contained within another, which gave us our solution:

=COUNTIF( sales_range, “*” & sku & “*” )

If that SKU is contained within any cell of the sales_range, then it will count it.
